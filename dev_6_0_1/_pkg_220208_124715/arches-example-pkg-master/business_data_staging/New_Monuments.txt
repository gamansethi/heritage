A series of silty organic layers interleaved with alluvial deposits were revealed, containing Roman pottery, butchered animal bone, and a number of small finds including bone hair pins, metalwork, and glass vessel sherds. The dump deposits spanned a period from the mid to late 2nd century up to the late 4th or early 5th centuries AD, with occasional gaps in the record during which other activity took place, as indicated by the burials and structural remains identified in Area B of the excavation.CREATION DATE: 150ADDESTRUCTION DATE: 410ADPERIOD: Early RomanMONUMENT TYPE: MIDDENPERIOD: Mid RomanMONUMENT TYPE: HUMAN REMAINSPERIOD: Late RomanMONUMENT TYPE: LAND RECLAMATIONNAME: Mid-Late Roman cemetery, Area B, Brayford Wharf East, LincolnLOCATION: {  "type": "FeatureCollection",  "features": [    {      "type": "Feature",      "properties": {},      "geometry": {        "type": "Point",        "coordinates": [          -0.543305201496826,          53.226352787696        ]      }    }  ]}DESCRIPTION: Human remains indicating the presence of a Roman cemetery were identified following an excavation in advance of construction at Brayford Wharf East, Lincoln. 11 individuals were identified, of whom seven were neonatal. Some of the burials demonstrated "deveian" burial practices, including prone burial and decapitation. The unusual demographic spread of the burials appears to indicate a larger cemetery in the vicinity. The cemetery remains are thought to represent a period from the mid 3rd century AD and well into the 4th century AD."CREATION DATE: 250ADDESTRUCTION DATE: 350ADPERIOD: RomanMONUMENT TYPE: CEMETERYMONUMENT TYPE: CREMATION CEMETERYMONUMENT TYPE: INHUMATION CEMETERYNAME: Possible late Roman buildings, Area B, Brayford Wharf East","CREATION DATE: 300ADDESTRUCTION DATE: 410ADLOCATION: {  "type": "FeatureCollection",  "features": [    {      "type": "Feature",      "properties": {},      "geometry": {        "type": "Point",        "coordinates": [          -0.543251432803559,          53.226612835429        ]      }    }  ]}DESCRIPTION: Excavation in advance of construction at Brayford Wharf East, Lincoln revealed evidence for late Roman structural remains inferred from a late Saxon robber trench and limestone rubble pit fill.PERIOD: RomanMONUMENT TYPE: BUILDINGMONUMENT TYPE: BEAM SLOTMONUMENT TYPE: ROBBER TRENCHNAME: Roman boundary features, Brayford Wharf East, LincolnCREATION DATE: 150ADDESTRUCTION DATE: 200ADLOCATION: {  "type": "FeatureCollection",  "features": [    {      "type": "Feature",      "properties": {},      "geometry": {        "type": "Point",        "coordinates": [          -0.543255,          53.226618        ]      }    }  ]}DESCRIPTION: Ditches and parallel fence lines of likely Roman date were identified during excavation at Brayford Wharf East.
